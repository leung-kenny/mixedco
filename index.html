      <h4 class="content-header">Who We Are</h4>
        <p class="content-body">
          Mixed Company, Stanford's oldest co-ed a cappella group, performs top-40s, rock, jazz, indie, and everything in between.  Mixed Co was recently featured on several Best of College A Cappella and Voices Only compilation albums, and a track from their most recent album, Undeclared, was named one the Recorded Acappella Review Board's "Tracks of the Year".<br/><br/>Last spring, the group embarked on a Service-through-Singing tour to Hawaii, where they performed for retirement homes, crowds on the street, and even a pair of elephants at the Honolulu Zoo!  The Co's biggest gig of the year is the anti-Valentines Day extravaganza known throughout campus as "Love Sucks"--through song, skits, and scantily-dressed performers, Mixed Co celebrates and satirizes romance at Stanford.  Beyond the rehearsals, gigs, tours, and recordings, Mixed Co is a tight-knit group of friends who share a love for singing and solo-cup red.
