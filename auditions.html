        <p class="content-body">
          Auditions for the 2014-2015 school year will be held during the first week of classes on <strong>Tuesday, September 23</strong> and <strong>Wednesday, September 24</strong>. There will be more details to come on this webpage as the date approaches, and keep an eye out for flyers across campus! Reading this now is a great way to give yourself a head start!
        </p>
        <ol class="audition-list">
          <li>
            <div class="list-title">Sign up.</div>
            <div class="list-content">We will be manning a table in White Plaza all day throughout NSO (New Student Orientation). Audition slots are 10 minutes long, and you may audition on either of the two available days. Be sure to sign up early to secure a time slot that's convenient for you, and leave enough time for you to show up a few minutes early that day!</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="list-title">Choose a song.</div>
            <div class="list-content">You will be asked to perform a song of your choosing during your audition. We donâ€™t care what song you choose! In the past, members have auditioned with top-40 hits, classic rock ballads, choral hymns, and even "Happy Birthday." Just pick a song that shows off your own personality and vocal abilities. Additionally, we are always looking for beatboxers/vocal percussionists, so feel free to also prepare something that showcases that for us if it's your thing!</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="list-title">Choose an object of personal significance.</div>
            <div class="list-content">This is purely for fun. We'll have you tell the story behind your object to help us get to know you better!</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="list-title">Find your audition location.</div>
            <div class="list-content">You'll want to arrive 5-10 minutes before your audition slot on the second floor of Tresidder Union (map). Some friendly group members will sit outside the audition room and chat with you while you fill out a form asking a few questions.</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="list-title">Enter the audition room.</div>
            <div class="list-content">When you enter the room for your audition, you will be greeted enthusiastically by The Co.</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="list-title">Warm up your voice.</div>
            <div class="list-content">To start your audition, we will have you sing up and down a few scales as we accompany you on the piano. You'll be able to sing these on any vowel, word, or syllable you prefer. This exercise will help us observe your singing range and think about if you'd sing with us best as a soprano, alto, tenor, or bass.</div>
          </li>     
          <li>
            <div class="list-title">Do pitch recall.</div>
            <div class="list-content">For pitch recall, we will play a sequence of three or four notes for you on the piano and ask you to sing the sequence back to us the way you heard it. Then we will play another, slightly longer sequence for you. Finally, we will play six notes in sequence.</div>
          </li>     
          <li>
            <div class="list-title">Sing your solo</div>
            <div class="list-content">And now, your solo. This is your chance to let loose! Your solo will really give us a good feel for your voice and your unique vibe as a performer, so we strongly encourage you (again) to sing the song you love to perform the most.</div>
          </li>     
          <li>
            <div class="list-title">Show and tell.</div>
            <div class="list-content">With all the singing out of the way, you'll simply be asked to show and talk about the object that you brought with you. After this step, you will have finished your entire Mixed Co audition!</div>
          </li>                                        
        </ol>

        <p class="content-body">
