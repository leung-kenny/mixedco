		<bio>Virginia (who also goes by Val, or the Virginal Queen Val) is a junior. She has been a soprano in the group for two years and the president last year, my sophomore year. Her third favorite color doesn't matter, Eric Hermann, but her spirit animal is definitely a mother goose. Mixed Co or Die ladies and gents, and always remember: sops on top.</bio>

An avid musical theater geek who majors in extracurriculars, if she's not in rehearsal with Mixed Co, she's probably in rehearsal somewhere else, or walking around campus belting "Let It Go" from the top of her lungs. Her third favorite color is mint.</bio>

		<bio>Laine, an alto and a junior in Product Design, served as Financial Officer and Performance Manager of 2013-14 Co. Being part of Mixed Co has proved to be one of the best decisions of her life, among buying American flag garter leggings and not cutting her own bangs in the 7th grade. She's originally from Chicago and unashamedly enjoys her Midwestern accent, daily naps, and Taco Bell.</bio>

		<bio>Abby, a sophomore from Boston, is thrilled to be returning for her second year in Mixed Co as Performance Manager and Financial Officer, and only moderately concerned that someone thought it was a good idea to put her in charge of the money. Although she auditioned as a soprano, Abby sings alto in the group, forcing her to fall to her knees and scream to the darkening skies, "WHO AM I?!" Abby spends her free time watching Netflix with her roommate and explaining to people what she is going to do with an English degree.</bio>

		Tim, a sophomore from THE GREAT FIRST STATE OF DELAWARE, is so excited to be coming back to the group in 2014-2015 to serve as Music Director. You can talk to him any time about politics, race, being a baritone in a co-ed group (not impossible!), making weird noises with your mouth (nothing quite like beatboxing), musical theater or sports. In his free time, you can find him binge-watching TV (Homeland, West Wing and House of Cards are some favorites) or sleeping. MIXEDCO4LYF.
